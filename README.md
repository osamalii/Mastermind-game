# Mastermind-game
The goal of this project is to make the MasterMind game using Shell script sh (The Shell is the program that manages
command prompt.)
MasterMind is a logic game in which you have to find a combination of 4 to 5 different colors among 9 (resp 10).
The machine chooses a combination then the player has a maximum of 10 turns to find it.
Each time the player offers a combination, the script must determine automatically how many letters are good placed, how many are misplaced, and display these numbers.
To start a game, you must have an account(Locally stored in joueurs.txt). in the game, you can save your progress to continue afterwards.
